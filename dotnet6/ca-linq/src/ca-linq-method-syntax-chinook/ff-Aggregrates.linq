//Aggregrates
//.Count() method or .Count property, same result, usually does not need a delegate expression
//.Sum(), .Max(), .Min(), .Average(), require a delegate expression so all are methods

//aggregrates work ONLY on a collection of data NOT on a single row
//a collection CAN have 0, 1 or more rows
Albums

//List all Albums showing, the Title, Artist Name and number of tracks
//on that album

//x (is the current Album instance/record/row).Tracks(navigational property).aggregrate
//because Tracks is a collection of the Album instance (ICollection<T>) or (IEnumerable<T>)
//we can use the aggregrate on the expression
//HOWEVER
//we can NOT go x.Artist.aggregrate BECAUSE Artist is NOT a collection
